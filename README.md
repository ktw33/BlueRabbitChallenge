# BlueRabbitChallenge

To launch the App: 
-clone this repo and open it up in your code editor
-'npm install' to install the dependencies
-'npm run start' to start the front and backend servers concurrently
-open up http://localhost:1234 to view the app

Design Notes:<br>
-I used a MongoDB database and React on the frontend because we were discussing these technologies last week.<br>
-The runtime environment is Node and the server is built with Express.  I like the express middleware design pattern because I find it easy to troubleshoot and update. 
-With the short time window I used Parcel as my bundle because it's super fast to set up.  In a larger app that needs more configuration I might use webpack instead. 

Other Notes: 
-I wasn't able to get to the file upload requirement within the time window but I may go back and add it in. 
-With more time I would also add in some specific error handling with try catch blocks in the middleware.
-I would also add some more security to the server
-The styling isn't pretty but it works

I had a lot of fun working on this challenge!
